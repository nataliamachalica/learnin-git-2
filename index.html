        <p><i>Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?</i><br>
        Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.<br></p>
        <p>Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.<br>
        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br>
        Because I'm easy come, easy go, <i>little high, little low.</i><br></p>
        <p>Anyway the wind blows<br>
        Doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br></p>
        
        <p>Mama just killed a man<br>
        Put a gun against his head<br>
        Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.<br></p>
        <p>Mama, life had just begun<br>
        But now I've gone and thrown it all away.<br></p>
        <p>Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry,<br>
        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br>
        Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.<br></p>
        
        <p>Too late, my time has come<br>
        Sends shivers down my spine<br>
        Body's aching all the time.<br></p>
        <p>Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
        Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.<br></p>

        <p>Mama, ooh <i>(anyway the winds blow),</i><br>
        I don't wanna die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.<br></p>

        <p>I see a little silhouette of a man,<br>
        <i>Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.</i><br>
        <p><i>Thunderbolt and Lightning, very very fright'ning me.</i><br></p>
        <p><i>(Galileo)</i> Galileo<br>
        <i>(Galileo)</i> Galileo<br>
        Galileo figaro, <i>magnifico.</i><br></p>
        <p>I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.<br>
        <i>He's just a poor boy from a poor family,<br>
        Spare him his life from this monstrosity.</i><br></p>
        <p>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br></p>
        <p>Bis-mil-lah!<br>
        No, we will not let you go. <i>(Let him go)</i><br>
        Bis-mil-lah !<br>
        We will not let you go. <i>(Let him go)</i><br>
        Bis-mil-lah !<br></p>
        <p>We will not let you go. <i>(Let me go)</i><br>
        We'll not let you go. <i>(Let me go)</i><br>
        We'll not let you go. <i>(Let me go)</i><br>
        Ah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br></p>
        <p><i>(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia)</i><br>
        Mamma mia, let me go.<br></p>
        <p><i>Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.</i><br></p>

        <p>So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye,<br>
        So you think you can love me and leave me to die.<br>
        Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,<br>
        just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.<br></p>

        <p>Nothing really matters, anyone can see,<br>
        Nothing really matters,<br>
        Nothing really matters to me.<br>
        Anyway the wind blows.</p>
